    <p>When tiny fish are released in large bodies of water, they can grow to prodigious sizes, officials warn. Last summer, tons of swordfish escaped a Panama City hatchery, stranding between 100,000 and 300,000 fish in the Gulf of Mexico after moving from their artificial wetlands to a tank far larger than the pen. Most of the fish were recaptured, but the escape prompted biologists to warn people to steer clear of the nimble flounder-like species.</p>
    <p>Releasing goldfish into lakes and streams can result in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fatness</li>
        <li>Sorrow</li>
    </ul>
